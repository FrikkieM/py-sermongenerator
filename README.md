# py-sermongenerator
A simple HTML generator for Taberna Dei. 

It accepts a date in YYYYMMDD and then looks in the 'WebsitePreke' folder for all sermons preached on that date.
These are then ordered by campus. 

It then generates the HTML for the Campus, Pastor, Title, MP3 link and PDF link for our church's website in <table> format.
